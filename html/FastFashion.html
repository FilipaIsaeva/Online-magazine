            <p class="text">“The newest collection of the season is out” - your friend tells you. It’s spring again and you think it’s time to refresh your wardrobe. You go to the mall to check the new clothes that have just arrived. Suddenly, you remember last spring. You bought cheap, trendy clothes but their quality was not good and you threw them out after a few months. This is known as fast fashion.</p>

        <div class="text_wrap">
            <h3>What's the fuss with fast fashion about?</h3>
            <p class="text2">Fast fashion refers to cheap, trendy clothes which are inspired from the catwalk and are soon released in popular clothing stores. This is a serious issue because fast fashion uses trend replication, rapid production, and low quality materials in order to bring cheap styles to the public. Unfortunately, this results in harmful impacts to the environment, human well-being and our wallets.</p>

        <div class="text_wrap">
            <h3>Why is it so bad?</h3>
            <p class="text2">Fast fashion has a large impact on the environment and the people involved in its production. The environmental damage, which the fashion industry continues to create, is in large part due to fast fashion. Brands use toxic chemicals, dangerous dyes, and synthetic fabrics which seep into water supplies in foreign countries (where the clothing is made) and at home when the clothing is washed.<br><br>Each year, the clothing that is thrown away amounts to about 11 million tons in the US. These garments, full of chemicals, almost never break down and they release toxic chemicals in the air. As a result, we suffer as well. Some garments and accessories have dangerous amounts of lead in them, and exposure to lead increases one’s risk of infertility, heart attacks, skin problems and etc.</p>

        <div class="text_wrap">
            <h3>Can we do something about it?</h3>
            <p class="text2">This is a serious problem but we can make an impact. Next time you’re going shopping, think about whether it is a good idea to go to the mall or some thrift store. Thrift stores can offer you a brand new piece of clothing or something that is in a good condition for a low price. Also, it is very likely that this would be the only one in store so you’re buying something unique!<br><br>Another alternative is shopping from a conscious fashion brand. Brands like PACT, thredUP and Everlane offer customers fashionable clothes at affordable prices. Moreover, buying clothes from a responsible brand ensures that you have agency over your personal style, are getting a quality product, and are protecting those that need it most.</p>
